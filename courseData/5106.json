        "description": "Economic theories are fables: simplified stories that convey insight by distilling complex realities into stylized, imaginary settings. In this course, we aim to look past the mathematical wrapper that often serves auxiliary purposes in economic research, and instead extract the core lessons offered by modern economic theory.\n\r\nThe course is organized into two main parts. In the first part, we focus on the foundational tools required to formulate a sound economic theory. This includes learning logic and game theory in a constructive manner. Students are expected to master the material in this section and develop the analytical skills that will be essential for the remainder of the course.\n\r\nIn the second part, we explore a range of topics from applied economic theory. The objective here is not to work through technical details, but to understand the fundamental incentive mechanisms underlying classic results, such as free-riding in teamwork, stable matching in marriage markets, Arrow's impossibility theorem, and persuasion through information concealment.",

Structural models are the key components in modern Industrial Organization. We will start by introducing production function estimation. Demand estimation will be the main part of this course. We will also cover empirical applications in different industries, and see how these empirical techniques apply to analyses of competition policies. \n\r\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with knowledge and toolkit to conduct empirical analyses that involves structural models, to evaluate economic/business policies, and to critically read quantitative research papers.",

The grade of your class presentation depends on several factors such as the successfulness of your presentation and the importance of the selected article. Your final grade is determined by your class presentation (0 or 10%), term paper (70%) and the mid-term examination (20% or 30%). The literature with a star (*) in the syllabus will be discussed in class if we have enough time. Sit in the class is not suggested since you are likely to waste your time.",

        "description": "Location matters. Economic activities vary across space. Locations shape individuals' labor market opportunities, residential choices, schooling, and accessibility to consumption and services. For firms, locations determine the cost of inputs and outputs, the level of competition, accessibility to markets, local regulations and policies, and, thus, profits. The aggregation of individuals’ and businesses’ location decisions affects the size and performance of cities and regions.\n\r\nThis course will be taught in Mandarin, though most, if not all, course materials will be in English. The course, Topics in Urban Economics, designed for students with an advanced understanding of microeconomics and econometrics, introduces core ideas and models in urban economics, especially related to city formation, size, productivity, and housing prices. In this course, we will apply microeconomic concepts to understand the differences in economic activities across spaces. We will also investigate the role of cities and regions in aggregate economic development. Finally, we will discuss applications to related fields in economics, including labor economics, economics of race and discrimination, environmental economics, and other socioeconomic topics related to spaces.\n\r\nAnother main goal of this course is to introduce research strategies, modeling tools, and potential measurement and identification problems while studying urban economics. These tools and methods can also be useful in various economic topics, especially for your thesis. ",
