        "description": "This course is a research-and-practice seminar on AI-assisted academic writing. Each week, students read and discuss journal articles on generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) in academic writing and L2 writing contexts, and complete short practice tasks that connect research insights to their own writing and research design. The final course product is a full paper in which students explore a self-selected topic within AI-assisted academic writing research areas (e.g., AI feedback uptake, AI literacy, paraphrasing practices, policy/disclosure, AWE vs GenAI, learner perceptions).
