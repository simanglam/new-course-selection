The first objective is to enhance fundamental operating skills, focusing on milling machines, lathes, and benchwork techniques. This foundational training aims to equip participants with the sharpened competencies for effective machine operation. The second objective involves the development of advanced manufacturing skills in milling machining and lathe machining. The third part of this course is target to the additive manufacturing process and the computer numerical control machine (CNC). The G-code based controlling system is developed. Learn how to operate the CNC machine and how to program for the work piece machining is the main subject in this course. ",

It is designed to enhance students’ ability to independently apply the machining knowledge and practical experience acquired during Factory Internship (I). Students will be required to independently complete assigned workpieces, adhering to specified dimensional and quality standards.\n\r\nIn addition to traditional machining practices, this course introduces students to Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools. Instruction will include both theoretical knowledge and practical demonstrations, using the students’ own workpieces from Factory Internship (I) as teaching examples for CNC operation and programming.  \n\r\nThrough this integrated approach, students will not only develop hands-on experience with CNC machining, but also gain a deeper understanding of its critical role in modern manufacturing and precision engineering.\n",

        "description": "Overview: This course introduces Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and its applications with an integrated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tool. A review of CNC and machining operations will be conducted first, followed by an introduction to ISO Numerical Control (NC) codes format and a comprehensive interpretation of NC programs, including hands-on editing and writing practices. Shop floor operation will follow after the familiarity with an interactive 3D machine tool (I3DMT) software system. A worry-free last-mile integration application scenario will be introduced and practiced for online collision-free operation through an asynchronous collision detection algorithm. Talented students will be cultivated for online digital reality and smart machine tools in the manufacturing industry. Students can learn systematic thinking and solutions.\n\r\nObjectives: To cultivate students to be familiar with not only the basic application of CAM but also simulation-based digital manufacturing application practice.\n",

Root-locus analysis and design\r\n- In this section, we will learn a graphical method, named the root-locus method, for determining pole locations of LTI systems with one unknown parameter.\r\n- We will then apply this method to design feedback control satisfying the stability and tracking requirements.\r\nPart II. Nyquist analysis and design\r\n- In this section, we will learn a frequency-domain based tool, called the Nyquist method, for performance analysis and control design for LTI systems.\r\n目標：使學生具備以古典控制理論設計控制器之能力\n",
